## Why

Agent guidance is currently split across multiple documents that can drift or conflict. Updating and aligning these instructions now will reduce ambiguity for contributors and tooling, and keep expectations consistent as the project evolves.

## What Changes

- Update `AGENTS.md` to clarify working agreements, output style, and repo-specific norms.
- Update `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md` to align with `AGENTS.md` and remove conflicting or outdated guidance.
- Ensure both documents use consistent UK English, structure, and terminology.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `agent-instruction-docs`: Define and align agent guidance across `AGENTS.md` and `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md`.

### Modified Capabilities
- None.

## Impact

- Documentation only: `AGENTS.md` and `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md`.
- No code or runtime behaviour changes; no new dependencies.
